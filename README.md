**ABSTRACT:**
This project is based on the survival prediction of the people on the RMS Titanic. One of the reasons for the loss of lives on that ship was the shortage of lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although, some people were more likely to survive than others. In this ML model we will predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

**DATASET:** 
The dataset contains the passengers name, age, gender, socio-economic class etc.

**DATA ANALYSIS:**
The dataset has been divided into training and testing dataset. Here are some insights we had after analysing the data:
•	Pclass, sex, cabin and embarked are categorical features.
•	Comparison of genders is important, as females are more likely to survive.
•	The fare didn’t contribute much to the model.

**ALGORITHMS USED:**
The following problem is a classification problem so we used random classifier model as it works best for the model with an accuracy of
